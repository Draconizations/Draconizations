### ðŸŒ€ Hello! I'm Jake

(he/they pronouns)

I'm a 19 year old programming student from the netherlands. I also work on my own projects in my spare time. I'm always looking to learn new concepts, languages and frameworks.

Most of my time is spent on either school work, creating art, or on social media. I'm currently going for a degree in software development.

### Languages and Tools
Most of my current knowledge is in typescript/javascript. But I have experience with the following languages / frameworks as well.

Most of my current projects are frontend webdev, but I'm hoping to learn the backend soon as well.

I'm also slowly trying to learn the following!
- languages: php, rust, go, python, java
